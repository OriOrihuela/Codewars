'''Trolls are attacking your comment section!
A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".'''

def disemvowel(string):
    vowels = ['a','A','e','E','i','I','o','O','u','U']
    final_string = ""
    for i in string:
        if i not in vowels:
            final_string += i
    return final_string

    print(disemvowel("This website is for losers LOL!"))
    #>>> "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!"
    print(disemvowel("I want to break free"))
    #>>> "wnt t brk frr"
    print(disemvowel("Welcome to the jungle"))
    #>>> "Wlcm t th jngl"
    print(disemvowel("Smells like teen spirit"))
